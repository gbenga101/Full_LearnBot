# **Changelog: AI-Driven Personalized Learning System**

## **Introduction**
This changelog documents the development process of the AI-Driven Personalized Learning System, integrating a pre-existing frontend (`LearnBot`) hosted on GitHub Pages (`https://gbenga101.github.io/LearnBot`) with a new Flask-based backend. The project aims to simplify academic content using the Google Gemini API, with OCR for file processing and session-based memory. Development started on July 27, 2025, with an entry-level frontend developer and expert AI guidance.

**Environment**:
- **OS**: Windows 10
- **IDE**: VS Code
- **Hardware**: Toshiba Portege R930 (4GB RAM, 250GB SSD, 2.7GHz 3rd Gen Intel)
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python 3.x with Flask

## **Milestones**

### **Milestone 0: Project Initialization and Planning (July 27-28, 2025)**

**Goals**:
- Define project scope and structure.
- Integrate existing frontend with backend planning.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Project Discussion and Requirements**:
   - Identified project goals: text simplification, file processing (PDFs/images), session memory.
   - Assessed hardware constraints and set a 2-week roadmap.
2. **Backend Structure Proposed**:
   - Designed a modular structure:
     - `app.py`: Main Flask app.
     - `config/`: Configuration (e.g., API keys).
     - `routes/`: API endpoints.
     - `services/`: Business logic (e.g., Gemini API, OCR).
     - `static/`: Upload storage.
     - `tests/`: Testing scripts.
   - Planned integration with frontend.
3. **Frontend Integration Planning**:
   - Reviewed existing `LearnBot` frontend structure (assets, css, js, index.html, etc.).
   - Decided to move `LearnBot` into `frontend/` subdirectory for local development.

**Tools**:
- VS Code, Git

**Challenges**:
- Ensuring frontend move doesnâ€™t affect GitHub Pages accessibility.
- Hardware limitations (4GB RAM) noted for future optimization.

**Success Criteria**:
- Structure defined and frontend move planned.

### **Milestone 1: Environment Setup and Frontend Move (July 27-28, 2025)**

**Goals**:
- Set up development environment.
- Move and verify frontend structure.

**Tasks Completed**:
1. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Checked Python and pip versions in VS Code terminal.
   - Planned installation if needed (pending confirmation).
2. **Create Project Directory and Initialize Git**:
   - Created `personalized-learning-system` folder.
   - Initialized Git with `.gitignore`:
     ```
     __pycache__/
     *.pyc
     venv/
     *.env
     static/uploads/
     api_key.txt
     ```
   - Committed initial setup.
3. **Plan Backend Structure**:
   - Defined file paths (config, routes, services, etc.) as outlined.
4. **Move Frontend into `frontend/`**:
   - Backed up `LearnBot` folder.
   - Moved `LearnBot` contents (assets, css, js, index.html, etc.) into `frontend/`.
   - Verified all files intact and `index.html` loads locally without errors.
5. **Update `.gitignore`**:
   - Added `frontend/node_modules/` (future-proofing).
   - Committed changes.
6. **Test Local Frontend**:
   - Opened `frontend/index.html` in browser, confirmed functionality with Bootstrap CSS.

**Tools**:
- VS Code, Git, File Explorer

**Challenges**:
- Ensured no impact on live GitHub Pages site (`https://gbenga101.github.io/LearnBot`).
- Handled manually due to no npm.

**Success Criteria**:
- Frontend moved and testable locally.
- Backend structure ready for setup.

**Notes**:
- Live site remains unaffected; local changes only.
- Stopped at 01:11 AM WAT, July 28, 2025, with 15 minutes remaining.

## **Pending Tasks (To Resume)**

- **Milestone 1 Continuation**:
  - Install Flask and dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
  - Create backend files (app.py, config.py, etc.).
  - Obtain Google Gemini API key.
  - Test Flask app and Gemini API.
- **Milestone 2**:
  - Connect frontend to backend.
  - Implement `/simplify` route.

## **Environment Setup**
- **Python**: To be confirmed installed.
- **Flask**: Planned for installation.
- **Requests**: Planned for API testing.
- **Tesseract**: Planned for Week 2 OCR.

## **Future Enhancements**
- OCR integration.
- Session memory with `sessionStorage`.
- Local testing and deployment adjustments.

## **Conclusion**
Progress is on track with frontend integration complete locally. Next session will focus on backend setup and API integration. Save this file in the project root (`personalized-learning-system/CHANGELOG.md`) for reference.
